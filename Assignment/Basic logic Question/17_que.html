<!-- Q.17 What is the result of the expression true && false || false && true? -->


To evaluate the expression true && false || false && true, we need to understand the order of precedence of the logical AND (&&) and logical OR (||) operators in JavaScript. The logical AND operator (&&) has higher precedence than the logical OR operator
(||). Therefore, expressions involving both operators are evaluated from left to right, and the logical AND operation is performed before the logical OR operation. Let's break down the expression step by step: true && false: This evaluates to false because
the logical AND operator returns false if any of its operands are false. false || false: This evaluates to false because the logical OR operator returns true only if both of its operands are false. So, the result of the expression true && false || false
&& true is false
