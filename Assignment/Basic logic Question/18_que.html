<!-- Q.18 What is a Loop and Switch Case in JavaScript define that ? -->

<body>

    <!-- In JavaScript, a loop is a programming construct that allows you to execute a block of code repeatedly until a specified condition is met. There are several types of loops in JavaScript, including:

  for loop: It repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. It consists of three parts: initialization, condition, and iteration. -->

    <script>
        for (initialization; condition; iteration) {
            // code to be executed
        }


        // while loop: It executes a block of code as long as the specified condition is true.

        while (condition) {
            // code to be executed
        }

        // do...while loop: Similar to the while loop, but it always executes the block of code once before checking the condition.

        do {
            // code to be executed
        } while (condition);

        //Switch case, on the other hand, is a control flow statement used to execute one block of code from multiple options based on the value of an expression. It's particularly useful when you have multiple conditions to check against a single variable.

        switch (expression) {
            case value1:
                // code to be executed if expression matches value1
                break;
            case value2:
                // code to be executed if expression matches value2
                break;
                // additional cases as needed
            default:
                // code to be executed if expression doesn't match any case
        }
    </script>
