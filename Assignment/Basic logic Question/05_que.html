<!-- Q.5 What the deference between undefined and undeclare in JavaScript? -->



<body>

    <script>
        //  Undefined:

        //     If a variable is declared but not assigned a value, or
        // if a
        // function does not explicitly
        // return anything, JavaScript assigns the value undefined to that variable or
        // function.
        // This means that the variable exists in the current scope, but it does not have a defined value.
        // Example:
        let x;
        console.log(x); // Output: undefined

        // Undeclared:

        //     If you
        // try to access a variable that has not been declared using
        // var,
        // let, or
        // const, JavaScript will
        // throw a ReferenceError because the variable is undeclared.
        // This means that the variable has not been defined in any scope, and attempting to access it will result in an error.
        // Example:

        console.log(y); // Throws ReferenceError: y is not defined
