<!-- Q.19 What is the use of is Nan function? -->

<body>

    The isNaN() function in JavaScript is used to determine whether a value is NaN (Not-a-Number) or not. NaN is a special value in JavaScript that represents an invalid number. The isNaN() function takes one argument and returns true if the argument is NaN,
    and false otherwise. If the argument passed to isNaN() is not of the type number, it is first converted to a number before the check is performed. Here's how you can use the isNaN() function:

    <script>
        console.log(isNaN(123)); // Output: false, since 123 is a valid number
        console.log(isNaN('Hello')); // Output: true, since 'Hello' cannot be converted to a number
        console.log(isNaN(NaN)); // Output: true, NaN is always considered NaN
        console.log(isNaN(undefined)); // Output: true, undefined cannot be converted to a number
        console.log(isNaN(null)); // Output: false, null is converted to 0, which is a valid number
    </script>
