<!-- Q.10 What is Condition Statement? -->


<body>

    <script>
        // A condition statement, also known as a conditional statement or conditional expression, is a programming construct that allows you to execute different blocks of code based on whether a specified condition evaluates to true or false. Condition statements are fundamental in controlling the flow of a program.

        // In JavaScript, the most common types of condition statements are:

        // if statement: It executes a block of code if a specified condition is true. Optionally, it can also execute a different block of code if the condition is false.
        //Example:

        let x = 10;

        if (x > 5) {
            console.log("x is greater than 5");
        } else {
            console.log("x is not greater than 5");
        }

        // else if statement: It allows you to check multiple conditions sequentially. If the condition associated with the if statement is false, it checks the condition associated with the else if statement, and so on.

        // Example:

        let time = 14;

        if (time < 12) {
            console.log("Good morning!");
        } else if (time < 18) {
            console.log("Good afternoon!");
        } else {
            console.log("Good evening!");
        }

        // switch statement: It evaluates an expression and executes the code associated with the first matching case label. Optionally, it can also have a default case to execute if no matching case is found.

        // Example:
        let day = "Monday";

        switch (day) {
            case "Monday":
                console.log("Today is Monday");
                break;
            case "Tuesday":
                console.log("Today is Tuesday");
                break;
            default:
                console.log("It's neither Monday nor Tuesday");
        }
    </script>
