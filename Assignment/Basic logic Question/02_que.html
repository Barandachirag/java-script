<!-- Q.2 How many type of Variable in JavaScript? -->


<body>

    <!-- In JavaScript, there are three main types of variables:

var: This was the original way of declaring variables in JavaScript. Variables declared with var are function-scoped, meaning they are accessible within the function in which they are declared, or globally if declared outside of any function. However, they are not block-scoped.

Example: -->
    var x = 10;

    <!-- let: Introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6), let allows you to declare block-scoped variables. Block scope means the variable is only accessible within the block (a pair of curly braces) where it is defined.

Example: -->
    let y = 20;
    <!-- 
    const: Also introduced in ES6, const is used to declare constants, which are block-scoped like variables declared with let, but their value cannot be reassigned once initialized.

Example: -->

    const z = 30;
